# ☕ 3D Coffee Cup Design

## 📌 Description
This is a 3D model of a coffee cup designed using **Onshape**. The model is based on a real-world cup, and all dimensions were measured manually using a measuring tape. The design demonstrates the use of basic CAD tools to model realistic objects.

## 🛠️ Tools Used in Onshape

At least 3 CAD features were used in this design:

- **Revolve**: To create the main body of the cup by revolving a 2D profile.
- **Sweep**: Used to create the handle of the cup along a defined path.
- **Fillet**: Applied to smooth the edges of the cup and handle.

> These tools were used to meet the task requirements.

## 📏 Measurement Tools

- **Manual Measuring Tape (Meter)** was used to take the real cup dimensions:
  - Top diameter: 9 cm  
  - Height: 8 cm  
  - Handle thickness: 1.5 cm

## 🎯 Purpose of the Design

- To practice using CAD tools in a real-world design scenario.
- To simulate a physical object for potential 3D printing.
- To enhance measurement and modeling accuracy.
- To learn how to transfer physical dimensions into a digital 3D model.
